Hi, I am Sidney de Sousa.

I am an Application Developer with interest in various aspects of Agile Methods, Software  Development technologies.
Professional, I've assisted various companies within the PHP stack.

Currently, even though I work as a PHP Developer, JavaScript is my main area of interest, which keeps me quite busy during and off working hours :).
